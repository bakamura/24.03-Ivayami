    m_Localized: "  It's a bit strange to write about myself this way, but knowing
      yourself is important, I guess.\r\n\r\n  A lot of people call me a nerd (whatever
      that means), but if I had to describe myself, I would say that I am, above
      all, honest. I have my own tastes and opinions and I don't change them to please
      others. Maybe that means I'm a bit selfish too, but that's it.\r\n\r\n  As
      you might expect, this behavior doesn't make me very popular, but I don't really
      care because I'm quite introverted. I like to spend my time alone, doing my
      own thing. I really like music and reading horror stories! Once I got the courage,
      it became my favorite genre to read, and maybe being a bit fearful is exactly
      what makes me like this kind of story so much? The tension, mystery and adrenaline
      are addictive! In addition to books, I also look for supernatural stories on
      the internet, which, even though I know they're made up, sometimes make my
      mind play tricks on me. Despite all this, I do have some close friends, people
      with whom I have been able to connect and who accept me as I am, regardless
      of labels and the fact that our tastes are all very different. Even though
      I tend to think of myself first, I like to be with everyone and I wouldn't
      trade them for anything.\r\n\r\n  When I get really agitated or anxious about
      something, I like to write about it. It's something that makes me calm down."

      of as a \"man of action\", always ready for whatever comes his way, even if
      things rarely go as planned because he is a bit too optimistic. Despite this,
      he insists on always solving everything on his own and remains confident even
      when his optimism fails. It's not the best of habits, but he's always someone
      who tries to do his best. His greatest example in life is his father: a firefighter
      who sacrificed himself to save people from a burning building when everyone
      had already given up and warned that the building could collapse at any moment.
      Going against norms, hierarchy and odds, he did what he thought was right.
      That is why, even with Marcos' bad reputation, he never left him aside, after
      all, they have known each other since childhood, even if this distanced him
      from the popular group. Joca is someone who sees value in people's inner selves,
      even if this also means that he sees himself kinda superior for thinking this
      way, even as a figure of authority. Still, it's great to have you with us.\r\n\n 
      I hope you didn't do anything crazy, Joca. Where have you gotten yourself into?"

      willing to meet new people and things, even though she has had some bad experiences
      with it, which have made her quite insecure and pessimistic.\r\n\r\n  I met
      her on a blog about occultism and, realizing that she had no idea what she
      was doing there, I managed to convince her to put her character aside so we
      could actually talk. We became friends and in the end it was she who introduced
      me to the other two members of our group: Marcos and Joca, who actually treat
      her like a little sister. Marcos is the annoying brother who loves to tease
      Luana and Joca is the protective brother.\r\n\r\n  That said, I think Luana
      has a crush on Joca, but she will never tell him and he will never realize
      it.\r\n\r\n  She wasn't at all excited about this trip, but she also didn't

      At first I thought he hated me, but over time I realized that he was just a
      bit stressed out and that my direct way of saying what I thought made it seem
      like I was \"picking a fight.\" In the end, what resolved these conflicts was
      us respecting each other's space, and today we get along well. Joca eventually
      told me a little about Marcos, since they've known each other for a long time.
      It's a bit of a dark story, in which his father drowned in alcohol and debt
      and turned the family upside down. With all this stress at home, Marcos preffered
      being on the streets and this made him ill-spoken, even though as far as we
      know he never really did anything wrong. However, I think that for many people
      the truth doesn't mather. Despite his fame, Marcos is a nice guy deep down.
      All it takes is someone willing to see that, after all, he was the one who
      took Luana off the \"bad path\" when she started smoking and wanted to try
      other things.\r\n\r\n  I know you're the last person who would leave me behind,
