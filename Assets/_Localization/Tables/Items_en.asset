      There was an earthquake and now we're trapped down here! But there must be

      I don''t care if it was an accident, a burglar, or a super-localized
      earthquake. The damage started on your side, so you''re the one who''s going
      to pay.

      Instead of locking yourself away for days, let''s discuss this
      in a civilized manner at my house, the situation is urgent.

      Sincerely,
