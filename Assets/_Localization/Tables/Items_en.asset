      I don''t care if it was an accident, a burglar, or a super-localized

      to pay.

      Instead of locking yourself away for days, let''s discuss this
      in a civilized manner at my house, the situation is urgent.

    m_Localized: 'Father, I''ve noticed some strange sounds coming from the graveyard
      at night, like, howling maybe? I don''t know. At first I thought it was the
      grave keeper, but I don''t see his <#e35540>white hatchback</color> parked
      anywhere. The gate was wide open with the key still in, so I took it upon myself
      to lock it and left the key at <#e35540>his house, right under the flower pot.</color>

      Please
      forgive me, I know I''m new at the church and may be overstepping my boundaries,
      but the sounds were really freaking me out. If you see him, could you please
      ask him to lock the gates at night? That would help me feel more at ease. Thank
      you.'

      I've always known this wasn\u2019t normal. I have to protect him, I can\u2019t

      He
      doesn''t want to leave home and just sits curled up in his room all day.

      Not
      even making his favorite pasta is working. I''m so tired.

      This afternoon
      I tried talking to him again, but he doesn''t respond no matter how much I
      try. I''m taking him to the hospital, there must be something they can do,
      this isn''t normal.'
