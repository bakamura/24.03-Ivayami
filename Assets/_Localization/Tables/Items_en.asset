      It''s been a week since the <#e35540>wall dividing
      our houses collapsed</color> and it is YOUR fault! The weeds from your poorly
      kept yard are starting to spread into mine, and I refuse to pay for all of
      this.

      I don''t care if it was an accident, a burglar, or a super-localized
      earthquake. The damage started on your side, so you''re the one who''s going
      to pay.

      Instead of locking yourself away for days, let''s discuss this
      in a civilized manner at my house, the situation is urgent.

      Sincerely,

      Geraldo'

      but if this isn't the perfect opportunity, I don't know if I'll ever get one.
      We knew the city was ancient, but this looks like something out of a movie!
      Ruins of an ancient civilization that mysteriously disappeared, found by chance
      when we took a detour from the main excavation that will open the new road.\n\n 
      Honestly, it's like a childhood dream come true. I can't wait to enter that
      temple or wherever it is and discover some lost treasures! "

      to be trapped in this place at all, so we need to be more careful from now

      I've never seen anything like it. Some shiny crystals around here seem to be
      the key, but so far no one has been able to decipher them. We're living quite

      anywhere. The gate was wide open with the key still in, so I took it upon myself

      Please
      forgive me, I know I''m new at the church and may be overstepping my boundaries,
      but the sounds were really freaking me out. If you see him, could you please
      ask him to lock the gates at night? That would help me feel more at ease. Thank
      you.'

      I haven''t seen you this morning, so hopefully
      you see this on your shift. So, yeah, the pipes are clogging again, they are
      too old for this. All of the replacements we have are falling apart, we need
      new pieces to work with, how long can we make do without any supplies?



      Honest
      to God, I can''t wrap my head around why our boss still wants us maintaining
      this place. No shipments have come in since the fire and no one came to help
      us rebuild the station. There were even newspaper articles about what happened,
      so why is nothing being done about it?! I feel like I''m going crazy here.



      Anyway,
      whenever you read this, could you also get the control lever back from the
      maintenance room? Pedro is taking way too long in fixing that, I''ll finsh
      the weld myself. The combination was <important>86239</important>. Thanks.'
