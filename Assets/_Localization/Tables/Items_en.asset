      It''s been a week since the <#e35540>wall dividing
      our houses collapsed</color> and it is YOUR fault! The weeds from your poorly
      kept yard are starting to spread into mine, and I refuse to pay for all of
      this.

      I don''t care if it was an accident, a burglar, or a super-localized
      earthquake. The damage started on your side, so you''re the one who''s going
      to pay.

      Instead of locking yourself away for days, let''s discuss this
      in a civilized manner at my house, the situation is urgent.

      Sincerely,

      Geraldo'

      at night, like, howling maybe? I don''t know. At first I thought it was the
      grave keeper, but I don''t see his <#e35540>white hatchback</color> parked
      anywhere. The gate was wide open with the key still in, so I took it upon myself
      to lock it and left the key at <#e35540>his house, right under the flower pot.</color>

      Please
      forgive me, I know I''m new at the church and may be overstepping my boundaries,
      but the sounds were really freaking me out. If you see him, could you please
      ask him to lock the gates at night? That would help me feel more at ease. Thank
      you.'
