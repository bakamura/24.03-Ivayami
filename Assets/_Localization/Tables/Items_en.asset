      Ruins of an ancient civilization that mysteriously disappeared, found by chance
      when we took a detour from the main excavation that will open the new road.\n\n 
      Honestly, it's like a childhood dream come true. I can't wait to enter that
      temple or wherever it is and discover some lost treasures! "

      the best idea, but now it's gone. Thanks to that, however, the entrance that
      brought us here almost collapsed, and although I'm excited, I wouldn't want
      to be trapped in this place at all, so we need to be more careful from now
      on.\r\n\r\n  Inside, the place is even more mysterious. There's some kind of
      mechanism in the middle of the room that must be used to open the doors, but
      I've never seen anything like it. Some shiny crystals around here seem to be
      the key, but so far no one has been able to decipher them. We're living quite
      an adventure!\r\n\r\n  We hear strange noises further ahead. I just hope they're
      not mummies wandering around here. "

    m_Localized: 'Father, I''ve noticed some strange sounds coming from the graveyard
      at night, like, howling maybe? I don''t know. At first I thought it was the
      grave keeper, but I don''t see his <#e35540>white hatchback</color> parked
      anywhere. The gate was wide open with the key still in, so I took it upon myself
      to lock it and left the key at <#e35540>his house, right under the flower pot.</color>

      Please
      forgive me, I know I''m new at the church and may be overstepping my boundaries,
      but the sounds were really freaking me out. If you see him, could you please
      ask him to lock the gates at night? That would help me feel more at ease. Thank
      you.'

      I haven''t seen you this morning, so hopefully
      you see this on your shift. So, yeah, the pipes are clogging again, they are
      too old for this. All of the replacements we have are falling apart, we need
      new pieces to work with, how long can we make do without any supplies?


      Not
      to mention, why are we still running this place? Do you recall the last time
      a new shipment came in? I knew the fire would slow things down, I just didn''t
      expect it to outright kill business like that... Sorry I just needed to vent
      a bit.


      Anyway, whenever you read this, could you also get the control
      lever back from the maintenance room? I know Pedro hasn''t fixed it yet, but
      I need it, I can''t let the boxcars sit in the open like that anymore. The
      combination was <important>86239</important>. Thanks.'
