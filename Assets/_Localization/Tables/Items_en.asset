      It''s been a week since the <#e35540>wall dividing
      our houses collapsed</color> and it is YOUR fault! The weeds from your poorly
      kept yard are starting to spread into mine, and I refuse to pay for all of
      this.

      I don''t care if it was an accident, a burglar, or a super-localized
      earthquake. The damage started on your side, so you''re the one who''s going
      to pay.

      Instead of locking yourself away for days, let''s discuss this
      in a civilized manner at my house, the situation is urgent.

      Sincerely,

      Geraldo'

      Please
      forgive me, I know I''m new at the church and may be overstepping my boundaries,
