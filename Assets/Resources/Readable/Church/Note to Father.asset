    Description: 'Father, I''ve noticed some strange sounds coming from the graveyard
      at night, like, howling maybe? I don''t know. At first I thought it was the
      grave keeper, but I don''t see his <#e35540>white hatchback</color> parked
      anywhere. The gate was wide open with the key still in, so I took it upon myself
      to lock it and left the key at <#e35540>his house, right under the flower pot.</color>

      Please
      forgive me, I know I''m new at the church and may be overstepping my boundaries,
      but the sounds were really freaking me out. If you see him, could you please
      ask him to lock the gates at night? That would help me feel more at ease. Thank
      you.'

    Description: "Padre, eu percebi uns sons estranhos vindo do cemit\xE9rio \xE0
      noite, tipo, uivos? N\xE3o sei. Eu pensei que fosse o coveiro, mas n\xE3o vi
      o <#e35540> carro branco dele </color> estacionado em lugar nenhum. O port\xE3o
      estava escancarado, com a chave ainda na fechadura. Eu achei melhor trancar,
      <#e35540> ent\xE3o deixei a chave na casa dele, embaixo do vaso de flores.</color>\nPor
      favor, me perdoe, sei que sou nova na igreja e posso estar indo al\xE9m dos
      meus deveres, mas os sons estavam realmente me assustando. Se o senhor ver
      o coveiro, poderia pedir para ele trancar os port\xF5es pelomenos \xE0 noite?
      Isso me deixaria muito mais tranquila. Obrigada."
