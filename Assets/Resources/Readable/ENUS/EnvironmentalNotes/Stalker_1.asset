  <Content>k__BackingField: 'I don''t know what to do anymore, his anxiety is getting
    worse.

    He doesn''t want to leave home and just sits curled up in his room
    all day.

    Not even making his favorite pasta is working. I''m so tired.

    This
    afternoon I tried talking to him again, but he doesn''t respond no matter how
    much I try. I''m taking him to the hospital, there must be something they can
    do, this isn''t normal.'
