  <Title>k__BackingField: Collapsed Wall Note
  <Content>k__BackingField: 'Mr. Joaquim,

    It''s been a week since the <#e35540>wall
    dividing our houses collapsed</color> and it is YOUR fault! The weeds from your
    poorly kept yard are starting to spread into mine, and I refuse to pay for all
    of this.

    I don''t care if it was an accident, a burglar, or a super-localized
    earthquake. The damage started on your side, so you''re the one who''s going
    to pay.

    

    Instead of locking yourself away for days, let''s discuss
    this in a civilized manner at my house, the situation is urgent.

    Sincerely,

    Geraldo'
