  <Content>k__BackingField: 'Father, I''ve noticed some strange sounds coming from
    the graveyard at night, like, howling maybe? I don''t know. At first I thought
    it was the grave keeper, but I don''t see his <#e35540>white hatchback</color>
    parked anywhere. The gate was wide open with the key still in, so I took it upon
    myself to lock it and left the key at <#e35540>his house, right under the flower
    pot.</color>

    Please forgive me, I know I''m new at the church and may be
    overstepping my boundaries, but the sounds were really freaking me out. If you
    see him, could you please ask him to lock the gates at night? That would help
    me feel more at ease. Thank you.'
