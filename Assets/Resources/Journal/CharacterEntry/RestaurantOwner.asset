    Name: "Mr Z\xE9"
    Descriptions:
    - "  This completely unsuspecting sir apparently saved me from the monsters,
      I have no idea how, but thank you! Despite his good intentions, he is clearly
      not in his right mind, as if he could freak out at any moment. He doesn't even
      blink!\r\n\r\n  Still, since he didn't show any hostile attitude and even showed
      concern for me, I think his restaurant is the closest thing to a \"safe place\"
      I'll have around here.\r\n\r\n  For some reason, he smells like avocado."
    - '  The note I found in the kitchen suggests he had a family. A wife who was
      "gone" and a son he swore to protect. I wonder if this has anything to do with
      the locked door to the men''s bathroom, because I could swear I heard a murmur
      coming from there.'
    - "  Now I realize that I hadn't even asked his name. Marcos calls him Mr. Z\xE9
      but I don't know if it's true or if he just made up the name."

    Name: Dono do Restaurante
    Descriptions:
    - "  Esse senhor nada suspeito aparentemente me salvou dos monstros, n\xE3o fa\xE7o
      a menor ideia de que forma, mas obrigada! Apesar das boas inten\xE7\xF5es,
      ele claramente n\xE3o est\xE1 em seu ju\xEDzo perfeito, como se a qualquer
      momento pudesse surtar. Ele nem pisca!\n  Ainda assim, como ele n\xE3o demonstrou
      nenhuma atitude hostil e at\xE9 se preocupou comigo, creio que o Restaurante
      dele seja o mais pr\xF3ximo de um \"lugar seguro\" que terei por aqui.\n  Por
      algum motivo, ele cheira a abacate."
    - "  A nota que encontrei na cozinha sugere que ele tinha uma fam\xEDlia. Uma
      esposa que \"se foi\" e um filho que ele jurou proteger. Me pergunto se isso
      tem rela\xE7\xE3o com a porta bloqueada do banheiro masculino, porque posso
      jurar que ouvi um murm\xFArio vindo de l\xE1."
    - "  Agora que me dei conta de que eu nem tinha perguntado o nome dele. O Marcos
      chama ele de Seu Z\xE9 mas n\xE3o sei dizer se \xE9 verdade ou ele s\xF3 inventou
      de chamar ele assim."
