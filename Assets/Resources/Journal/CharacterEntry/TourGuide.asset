    - "  I had almost forgotten, but I am certain that she was the figure I followed
      when I arrived in the city. Whether it was her intention to throw me into the
      midst of those abominations or if it was an unfortunate coincidence is a mystery,
      but the fact that she dresses like Jack the Ripper doesn't help.\r\n  Honestly,
      that smiling face doesn't fool me, but if she really knows as much about the
      city as she seems, maybe I can get some useful information by listening to
      what she has to say. Luckily, she calls herself a sort of tour guide who loves
      this place and seems more than willing to tell me about it.\r\n\r\n  Judging
      by her attire, maybe she was an important figure before everything here fell
      apart and Ivayami was swallowed by the mists."

    Descriptions:
    - "  Eu tinha quase me esquecido, mas tenho certeza de que ela foi a figura que
      eu segui quando cheguei na cidade. Se era a inten\xE7\xE3o dela me jogar no
      meio daquelas abomina\xE7\xF5es ou se foi uma infeliz coincid\xEAncia \xE9
      um mist\xE9rio, mas o fato de ela se vestir como o Jack, o Estripador n\xE3o
      ajuda.\n  Sinceramente, esse rosto sorridente n\xE3o me engana, mas se ela
      realmente sabe sobre a cidade tanto quanto parece, talvez eu consiga alguma
      informa\xE7\xE3o \xFAtil ouvindo o que ela tem a dizer. Por sorte, ela mesma
      se intitula como uma esp\xE9cie de guia tur\xEDstica que ama esse lugar e parece
      mais do que disposta a me contar sobre.\n\n  Julgando pela vestimenta, talvez
      ela fosse uma figura importante antes de tudo por aqui desmoronar e Ivayami
      ser engolida pelas brumas."
