    - "  Marcos and I have a unstable relationship, to say the least. At first I
      thought he hated me, but over time I realized that he was just a bit stressed
      out and that my direct way of saying what I thought made it seem like I was
      \"picking a fight.\" In the end, what resolved these conflicts was us respecting
      each other's space, and today we get along well. Joca eventually told me a
      little about Marcos, since they've known each other for a long time. It's a
      bit of a dark story, in which his father drowned in alcohol and debt and turned
      the family upside down. With all this stress at home, Marcos preffered being
      on the streets and this made him ill-spoken, even though as far as we know
      he never really did anything wrong. However, I think that for many people the
      truth doesn't mather. Despite his fame, Marcos is a nice guy deep down. All
      it takes is someone willing to see that, after all, he was the one who took
      Luana off the \"bad path\" when she started smoking and wanted to try other
      things.\r\n\r\n  I know you're the last person who would leave me behind, no
      matter what. What happened, Marcos?"

    Descriptions:
    - "  Marcos e eu temos uma rela\xE7\xE3o inst\xE1vel para dizer o m\xEDnimo.
      No come\xE7o achei que ele me odiava, mas com o tempo percebi que ele s\xF3
      \xE9 meio estressado mesmo e que o meu jeito direto de dizer o que eu penso
      fazia parecer que eu estava \"comprando briga\". No fim, o que resolveu esses
      conflitos foi cada um respeitar o espa\xE7o outro, e hoje em dia a gente se
      d\xE1 bem.\n  O Joca eventualmente me contou um pouco do Marcos, j\xE1 que
      eles se conhecem a um bom tempo. \xC9 uma hist\xF3ria meio pesada, em que o
      pai dele se afundou em \xE1lcool e d\xEDvidas e virou a fam\xEDlia de ponta
      cabe\xE7a. Com todo esse estresse em casa, o Marcos passou a preferir as ruas
      e isso fez ele ficar mal falado, mesmo que at\xE9 onde a gente saiba ele nunca
      fez nada de realmente errado. Ainda assim, acho que pra muita gente a verdade
      pouco importa.\n  Apesar dessa fama, o Marcos no fundo \xE9 um cara legal.
      S\xF3 precisa de algu\xE9m que esteja disposto a enxergar isso, afinal foi
      ele que afastou a Luana do \"mau caminho\" quando ela come\xE7ou a fumar e
      queria tentar outras coisas.\n\n  Eu sei que voc\xEA \xE9 o \xFAltimo que me
      deixaria para tr\xE1s, independente do caso. O que aconteceu, Marcos?"
