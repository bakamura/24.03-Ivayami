  - "  Marcos and I have a unstable relationship, to say the least. At first I thought
    he hated me, but over time I realized that he was just a bit stressed out and
    that my direct way of saying what I thought made it seem like I was \"picking
    a fight.\" In the end, what resolved these conflicts was us respecting each other's
    space, and today we get along well. Joca eventually told me a little about Marcos,
    since they've known each other for a long time. It's a bit of a dark story, in
    which his father drowned in alcohol and debt and turned the family upside down.
    With all this stress at home, Marcos preffered being on the streets and this
    made him ill-spoken, even though as far as we know he never really did anything
    wrong. However, I think that for many people the truth doesn't mather. Despite
    his fame, Marcos is a nice guy deep down. All it takes is someone willing to
    see that, after all, he was the one who took Luana off the \"bad path\" when
    she started smoking and wanted to try other things.\r\n\r\n  I know you're the
    last person who would leave me behind, no matter what. What happened, Marcos?"
