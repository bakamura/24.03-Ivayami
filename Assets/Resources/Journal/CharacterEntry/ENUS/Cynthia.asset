  - "  It's a bit strange to write about myself this way, but knowing yourself is
    important, I guess.\r\n\r\n  A lot of people call me a nerd (whatever that means),
    but if I had to describe myself, I would say that I am, above all, honest. I
    have my own tastes and opinions and I don't change them to please others. Maybe
    that means I'm a bit selfish too, but that's it.\r\n  As you might expect, this
    behavior doesn't make me very popular, but I don't really care because I'm quite
    introverted. I like to spend my time alone, doing my own thing. I really like
    music and reading horror stories! Once I got the courage, it became my favorite
    genre to read, and maybe being a bit fearful is exactly what makes me like this
    kind of story so much? The tension, mystery and adrenaline are addictive! In
    addition to books, I also look for supernatural stories on the internet, which,
    even though I know they're made up, sometimes make my mind play tricks on me.
    Despite all this, I do have some close friends, people with whom I have been
    able to connect and who accept me as I am, regardless of labels and the fact
    that our tastes are all very different. Even though I tend to think of myself
    first, I like to be with everyone and I wouldn't trade them for anything.\r\n 
    When I get really agitated or anxious about something, I like to write about
    it. It's something that makes me calm down."
