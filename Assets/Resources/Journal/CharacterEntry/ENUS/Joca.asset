  _text:
  - "  Joca is like the leader of the group. He's the one you'd think of as a \"man
    of action\", always ready for whatever comes his way, even if things rarely go
    as planned because he is a bit too optimistic. Despite this, he insists on always
    solving everything on his own and remains confident even when his optimism fails.
    It's not the best of habits, but he's always someone who tries to do his best.
    His greatest example in life is his father: a firefighter who sacrificed himself
    to save people from a burning building when everyone had already given up and
    warned that the building could collapse at any moment. Going against norms, hierarchy
    and odds, he did what he thought was right. That is why, even with Marcos' bad
    reputation, he never left him aside, after all, they have known each other since
    childhood, even if this distanced him from the popular group. Joca is someone
    who sees value in people's inner selves, even if this also means that he sees
    himself kinda superior for thinking this way, even as a figure of authority.
    Still, it's great to have you with us.\r\n\n  I hope you didn't do anything crazy,
    Joca. Where have you gotten yourself into?"
