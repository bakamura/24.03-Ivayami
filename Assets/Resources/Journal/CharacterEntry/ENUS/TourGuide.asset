  - "  I had almost forgotten, but I am certain that she was the figure I followed
    when I arrived in the city. Whether it was her intention to throw me into the
    midst of those abominations or if it was an unfortunate coincidence is a mystery,
    but the fact that she dresses like Jack the Ripper doesn't help.\r\n  Honestly,
    that smiling face doesn't fool me, but if she really knows as much about the
    city as she seems, maybe I can get some useful information by listening to what
    she has to say. Luckily, she calls herself a sort of tour guide who loves this
    place and seems more than willing to tell me about it.\r\n  Judging by her attire,
    maybe she was an important figure before everything here fell apart and Ivayami
    was swallowed by the mists."
