  _text:
  - "  This completely unsuspecting sir apparently saved me from the monsters, I
    have no idea how, but thank you! Despite his good intentions, he is clearly not
    in his right mind, as if he could freak out at any moment. He doesn't even blink!\r\n 
    Still, since he didn't show any hostile attitude and even showed concern for
    me, I think his restaurant is the closest thing to a \"safe place\" I'll have
    around here.\r\n\r\n  For some reason, he smells like avocado."
  - '  The note I found in the kitchen suggests he had a family. A wife who was "gone"
    and a son he swore to protect. I wonder if this has anything to do with the locked
    door to the men''s bathroom, because I could swear I heard a murmur coming from
    there.'
  - "  Now I realize that I hadn't even asked his name. Marcos calls him Mr. Z\xE9
    but I don't know if it's true or if he just made up the name."
