  - "  Lu is my best friend. People call her Goth and she even dresses like one,
    but in reality you can tell she only does it to show that she is \"cool and different\".
    Strange, yes, but she is a good person who is always willing to meet new people
    and things, even though she has had some bad experiences with it, which have
    made her quite insecure and pessimistic.\r\n  I met her on a blog about occultism
    and, realizing that she had no idea what she was doing there, I managed to convince
    her to put her character aside so we could actually talk. We became friends and
    in the end it was she who introduced me to the other two members of our group:
    Marcos and Joca, who actually treat her like a little sister. Marcos is the annoying
    brother who loves to tease Luana and Joca is the protective brother.\r\n  That
    said, I think Luana has a crush on Joca, but she will never tell him and he will
    never realize it.\r\n\r\n  She wasn't at all excited about this trip, but she
    also didn't want to be left out. If I felt a little bad for her before, imagine
    now! Where are you, Lu?"
