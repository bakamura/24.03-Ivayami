    - "  Joca is like the leader of the group. He's the one you'd think of as a \"man
      of action\", always ready for whatever comes his way, even if things rarely
      go as planned because he is a bit too optimistic. Despite this, he insists
      on always solving everything on his own and remains confident even when his
      optimism fails. It's not the best of habits, but he's always someone who tries
      to do his best. His greatest example in life is his father: a firefighter who
      sacrificed himself to save people from a burning building when everyone had
      already given up and warned that the building could collapse at any moment.
      Going against norms, hierarchy and odds, he did what he thought was right.
      That is why, even with Marcos' bad reputation, he never left him aside, after
      all, they have known each other since childhood, even if this distanced him
      from the popular group. Joca is someone who sees value in people's inner selves,
      even if this also means that he sees himself kinda superior for thinking this
      way, even as a figure of authority. Still, it's great to have you with us.\r\n\n 
      I hope you didn't do anything crazy, Joca. Where have you gotten yourself into?"

    Descriptions:
    - "  Joca \xE9 como o l\xEDder do grupo. O que voc\xEA pensaria de um \"homem
      de a\xE7\xE3o\", sempre pronto para o que der e vier mesmo que as coisas raramente
      saiam como ele planejou por ser um pouco otimista demais. Apesar disso, ele
      insiste em sempre resolver tudo sozinho e se mant\xE9m confiante mesmo quando
      o otimismo falha. N\xE3o \xE9 o melhor dos h\xE1bitos, mas \xE9 sempre algu\xE9m
      que tenta fazer o seu melhor.\n  Ele t\xEAm como maior exemplo na vida o pai:
      um bombeiro que se sacrificou para salvar pessoas de um pr\xE9dio em chamas
      quando todos j\xE1 haviam desistido e alertado que a constru\xE7\xE3o podia
      desabar a qualquer momento. Indo contra normas, hierarquia e probabilidades,
      ele fez o que achava certo.\nPor isso, mesmo com a m\xE1 fama do Marcos, ele
      jamais o deixou de lado, afinal eles se conhecem desde a inf\xE2ncia, mesmo
      que isso afastasse ele da panelinha dos populares. Joca \xE9 algu\xE9m que
      v\xEA valor no interior das pessoas, mesmo que isso tamb\xE9m signifique que
      ele se veja como algu\xE9m de certa forma superior por pensar assim, at\xE9
      como uma figura de autoridade. Ainda assim, \xE9 \xF3timo ter voc\xEA com a
      gente.\n\n  Espero que n\xE3o tenha feito nenhuma loucura, Joca. Onde voc\xEA
      se meteu?"
