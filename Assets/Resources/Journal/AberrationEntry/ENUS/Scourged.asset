  - "  These raw flesh humanoids were my welcome to Ivayami. I have no idea if they
    were ever human, and I really don't want to think about it right now.\r\n  Their
    flayed bodies, their arms tied to their bodies like a straitjacket, and their
    desperate screams make it seem like they're in deep pain.\r\n  Despite apparently
    having no eyes, they can see me, so hiding is the best option I have. They're
    not that fast, but they usually move in groups, and I shouldn't count on luck."
