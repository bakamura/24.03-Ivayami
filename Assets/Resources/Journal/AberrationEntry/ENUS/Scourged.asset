  - "  These raw flesh humanoids were my welcome to Ivayami. I have no idea if they
    were ever human, and I really don't want to think about it right now.\r\n\r\n 
    Their flayed bodies, their arms tied to their bodies like a straitjacket, and
    their desperate screams make it seem like they're in deep pain.\r\n\r\n  Despite
    apparently having no eyes, they can see me, so hiding is the best option I have.
    They're not that fast, but they usually move in groups, and I shouldn't count
    on luck."
