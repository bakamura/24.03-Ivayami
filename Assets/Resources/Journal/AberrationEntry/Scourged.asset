    - "  These raw flesh humanoids were my welcome to Ivayami. I have no idea if
      they were ever human, and I really don't want to think about it right now.\r\n\r\n 
      Their flayed bodies, their arms tied to their bodies like a straitjacket, and
      their desperate screams make it seem like they're in deep pain.\r\n\r\n  Despite
      apparently having no eyes, they can see me, so hiding is the best option I
      have. They're not that fast, but they usually move in groups, and I shouldn't
      count on luck."

    Descriptions:
    - "  Esses seres humanoides em carne viva foram minhas boas-vindas a Ivayami.
      N\xE3o fa\xE7o ideia se j\xE1 foram humanos em algum momento e realmente prefiro
      n\xE3o pensar nisso agora.\n\n  O corpo esfolado, os bra\xE7os presos ao corpo
      como uma camisa de for\xE7a e os gritos desesperados faz parecer que est\xE3o
      em profundo sofrimento.\n\n    Apesar de aparentemente n\xE3o terem olhos,
      eles conseguem me ver, ent\xE3o me esconder \xE9 a melhor op\xE7\xE3o que tenho.
      Eles n\xE3o s\xE3o t\xE3o r\xE1pidos, mas geralmente andam em grupo e eu n\xE3o
      deveria contar com a sorte."
