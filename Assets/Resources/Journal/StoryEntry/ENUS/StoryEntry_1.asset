  - "  Things are going from bad to worse. What I saw were really monsters, horrible
    things that surrounded me and it's like they were devouring my mind. I can't
    even remember what happened, but a very strange man helped me and took me to
    his restaurant. Now, we're locked in here and he told me to find a spare key
    in the pantry if I want to leave.\r\nEverything here is very old and even the
    food seems spoiled. Even though there are people here, it really is as if everything
    has been abandoned for a long time. What is going on here?!\r\n\r\n  At least
    he gave me a tip about Marcos' whereabouts! He said he saw him being taken by
    a police officer to the Police Station. I have a bad feeling about this, but
    it's better than nothing. Where could Joca and Luana have gone?"
