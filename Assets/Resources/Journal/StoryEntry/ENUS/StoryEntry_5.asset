  - '  The neighbor''s house was infested with monsters! What the hell happened there?!
    Well, at least I managed to get into the Deputy''s House, but there''s no sign
    of him. From the note he left, "he must no longer be alive", damn it!

    It
    seems like coming here was a waste of time, but who knows, maybe by deciphering
    the safe''s password I could at least find something useful, like the key to
    this house. I don''t want to go back the way of the monsters!'
