  - "  Today, Luana, Marcos, Joca and I are going to Ivayami, a small abandoned town
    in the countryside that is said to be haunted.\r\n  It's not the first time we've
    traveled together, but this time, at Joca's insistence, I was the one who chose
    the destination. We decided to leave late to spend the night there and return
    at dawn, after all, that's the time of the hauntings, right? Not that I really
    believe we'll see anything supernatural. At least I hope not!\r\n\r\n  Damn,
    how did things end up like this? Where is everyone?! Where did that train come
    from?! I only heard the whistle and then Marcos screaming. I could swear I saw
    it hitting us.\r\n  It seems that Joca ended up losing control and we went off
    the road, but where did they go?! Why did they leave me behind? No, something
    must have happened. I need to find them!\r\n  My head hurts..."
