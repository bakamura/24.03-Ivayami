  - "  When I finally got the key, the man called me and said that I should leave
    this town as soon as possible (needless to say!), and that if I saw \"something
    strange\" - maybe those monsters again - I should hide. Well, it's not like I
    had many options. No way I could face those things!\r\n\r\n  Well, I have a map
    of the town so I should be able to find my way to the police station at least.
    It's not too far from here, but I need to keep an eye on the surroundings to
    see if I can find any more clues about the others or anything I can use. Exploring
    a ghost town, that's what I wanted, right?! Well done, Cynthia!"
