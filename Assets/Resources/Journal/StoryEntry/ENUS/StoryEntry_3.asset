  - "  Okay, it's as I feared, this Police Officer is a freak! He didn't give me
    any direct answers, but if he didn't deny it, I can believe that Marcos really
    is here, arrested for who knows what reason!\r\n  He told me to go to the Deputy's
    House, leaving the Police Station and going right until I see the walls surrounding
    the residence. I just hope this Deputy is a little less crazy."
