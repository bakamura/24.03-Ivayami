  - "  I found two keys inside the safe. One of them must be the house key, but the
    other one has an inscription from the Police Station!\r\n  Well, I certainly
    can't trust that Police Officer, so I think my best chance is to go in through
    the back and get Marcos out of there. It's crazy, I know, but there's no other
    way. Monsters everywhere, crazy people, I can't take it anymore!\r\n  All I wanted
    to do was get out of here, but I would never forgive myself for leaving my friends
    behind. I'm the one who brought us here, so I just want to get this over with!"
